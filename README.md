## Key Features

### General Analysis

The **General Analysis** section of the dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the electric vehicle (EV) industry. It highlights key metrics such as the total number of electric vehicles, the average vehicle age, and the total number of unique EV models available in the market. A geographical map showcases the worldwide distribution of EVs, allowing users to visualize regional adoption trends. The growth in EV adoption is displayed through a line chart, illustrating the exponential rise in EV numbers over the years. Additionally, a pie chart categorizes EVs into Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), revealing their respective market shares. Finally, a bar chart ranks the top EV manufacturers based on their contribution to the industry, with Tesla leading the way by a significant margin.
